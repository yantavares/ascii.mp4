This is a project that transforms a video into ASCII art, converting each frame into text using any font you want. It offers two output modes:
	1.	Plays the video in text format directly in the terminal.
	2.	Saves the ASCII frames as a rendered .mp4 file in the output folder.

Example (takes a few seconds to load):

Requirements

	•	make (GNU)
	•	OpenCV2 (can be installed with libopencv-dev on Ubuntu or opencv on Fedora and Arch)
	•	g++ compiler (for the C++ engine)
	•	Python3 (for the Python engine)

Setup (UNIX systems)

	1.	Clone the repository:

  git clone https://github.com/yantavares/calabreso.txt.git
  cd calabreso.txt

	2.	If needed, make the play.sh file executable:

  chmod +x play.sh

	3.	Install the necessary packages:

   # For Ubuntu
   sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev
   pip install -r requirements.txt

	4.	(Optional) Add your video file to the videos folder, or use the provided SampleVideo.mp4.
	5.	(Optional) Place your preferred font (.ttf) in the fonts folder, or use the default font ComicMono.ttf.

How to Run the Project

To run the project, use the make command:

   make

You will choose between two execution modes:
	1.	Play in terminal: Displays the video as ASCII art directly in your terminal.
	2.	Save as MP4: Generates a rendered .mp4 file in the output folder.

Steps After Running make:

	1.	Select the font:
	•	The default is Comic Mono.
	2.	Choose the font size:
	•	Must be compatible with your terminal’s font size.
	•	Choose between 2 and 20.
	•	The default is 11.
	3.	Enter the video name:
	•	Choose a video from the videos folder.
	•	The default is SampleVideo.mp4.
	4.	Select the mode:
	•	Choose one of the options:
	•	1: Play in the terminal.
	•	2: Save as .mp4 in the output folder.

If you don’t respond to a prompt, the default values will be used.

Commands

	•	To run in the terminal or generate an ASCII mp4:

   make

Note: The video will be automatically resized to fit your terminal window, so don’t use a very small window.
	•	To play the video in the terminal after running make (without any additional processing):

   make play

Outputs

	1.	If you choose Mode 1, the video will be displayed directly in the terminal.
	2.	If you choose Mode 2, the rendered ASCII video will be saved as .mp4 in the output folder.

Additionally, all the individual ASCII frames of the video will be saved as .txt files in the output folder.
